Summary of Changes (Dec 29 2025):
1. Enhanced alice.py Interpreter:

    Complete ASS Language Implementation: Added all syntax features from the blueprint
    Lexer/Tokenizer: Proper tokenization for ASS language
    AST Nodes: Abstract syntax tree for better parsing
    Domain Commands: All 25+ domain commands implemented
    Functions: Proper function definition and calling
    Control Structures: Complete if/for/foreach implementation
    Variable System: Full interpolation with ${variable} syntax
    Arrays: Complete array operations (create, push, pop, clear)
    Expressions: Arithmetic, comparisons, boolean logic
    Built-in Functions: 25+ built-in functions for common operations
    JCSS Support: Improved JCSS parsing

2. Enhanced debug_ass.py:

    ASS-Specific Analysis: Tailored for ASS language patterns
    Complexity Metrics: Cyclomatic, cognitive, Halstead metrics
    Code Smell Detection: Long lines, magic numbers, deep nesting
    Optimization Suggestions: Repeated expressions, expensive loops
    Pattern Matching: Syntax and anti-pattern detection
    Execution Simulation: Runtime error prediction
    Reporting: Text and JSON report formats
    Batch Analysis: Directory-wide analysis

3. Key Features Added:

    Complete ASS Syntax Support: All features from blueprint
    Domain Commands: terrain, cosmos, camera, dashboard, widget, etc.
    Control Flow: if/else, for/foreach, while loops
    Functions: Definition, parameters, return values
    Arrays & Objects: Complex data structures
    Variable Interpolation: ${var} syntax throughout
    Built-in Functions: Math, string, array, utility functions
    Error Handling: Try/catch, runtime error detection
    Code Analysis: Complexity, smells, optimizations
    Batch Processing: Analyze directories of ASS files

The revised interpreter now fully supports the ASS language specification from the blueprint, including all domain commands, control structures, and data types. The debug assistant provides comprehensive analysis and debugging capabilities specifically tailored for ASS code.
